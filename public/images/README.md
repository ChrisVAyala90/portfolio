# Profile Photo Instructions

To add your profile photo:

1. Take your wedding photo and crop it to focus on just you (Christopher - the person in the white blazer)
2. Make it square (1:1 aspect ratio) - recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger
3. Save it as: `christopher-ayala-profile.jpg`
4. Place it in this directory: `/public/images/`

The photo should be:
- A headshot or upper body shot
- Well-lit and clear
- Professional appearance
- Square format (very important!)

You can use any photo editing tool:
- Mac Preview: Open photo → Tools → Adjust Size → Make it square
- Online: Use https://www.photopea.com or https://squoosh.app
- Or any photo editor you prefer
